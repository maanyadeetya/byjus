        My favorite hobby is soccer. Everyday when I come back from school, I go to soccer practice and we learn how to be better at soccer. I also kick a soccerball around when I am bored. I have played soccer for over 4 years and I like it more each season. Soccer can be good for a person's physical health and make them a fast runner, and increase their strength. It is also very fun to play with your friends and family.
